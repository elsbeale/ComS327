This is an extension of the professor's code which implements some new features. Combat is now handled in multiple rounds as opposed to the old win/loss system. 
The PC can equip items to boost their various stats like speed and damage. All NPCs will not target each other. There is now a boss npc which the player must 
find and defeat to win the game. If the player's health is reduced to 0 before this happens then they will be given a game over message. This new combat system
is turn based where the attacking entity is the one who moves into a cell already occupied by another entity.
