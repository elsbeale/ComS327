This is a complete conversion of our old code to C++. It is also an addition that not only adds a "fog of war" effect to the map but also the ability to teleport the player character to a different location on the map.The fog of war can be toggled by using the f key. The teleport feature is mapped to the g key. Upon activation, the user simply needs to navigate the cursor to where the want the pc to teleport to and press g to send them there(or r for a random location).
