This is an add onto the proffessors code that gives the user a UI to control the player character (@).
This was accomplished by utilizing the ncurses library. Stairs were also given functionality in that the
player character is allowed to traverse up and down stairs but monsters are not. If a player decides to
use the stairs an entirely new dungeon will be generated that will represent the new floor the player is
now on.
