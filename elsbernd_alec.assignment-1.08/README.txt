This is an addon to the professor's code which adds more complexity to the NPC's of the game with the inclusion of a parser and dice class. Instead of hardcoding unique monsters into the game we instead were tasked with implementing a parser that can read a text file of various monsters and create these monsters in the game. We also created a dice class to stick to the RPG style. All monsters will need to have the following keywords in the text file passed in to work properly: Name (NAME), Description (DESC), Color (COLOR), Speed (SPEED), Abilities (ABIL), Hitpoints (HP), Damage (DMG), Symbol (SYMB), and Rarity (RRTY). Items are also implemented in a similar fashion to monsters taking the following keywords: Name (NAME), Description (DESC), Type (TYPE), Color (COLOR), Hit Bonus (HIT), Damage Bonus (DAM), Dodge Bonus (DODGE), Defense Bonus (DEF), Weight (WEIGHT), Speed bonus(SPEED), Special attribute (ATTR), Value (VAL), Artifact Status (ART), and Rarity (RRTY).
